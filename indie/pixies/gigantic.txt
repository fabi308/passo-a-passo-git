And this I know
His teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day
Into a shady place
With her lips she said
She said

Hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
Hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
Hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big big love

Lovely legs there are
What a big black mask
What a hunk of love
Walk her every day into a shady place
He's like the dark, but I'd want him

Hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
Hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball
Hey paul, hey paul, hey paul, let's have a ball

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big big love
