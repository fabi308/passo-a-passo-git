Oh (stop!)

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah (yeah)
Your head will collapse
And there's nothing in it, and you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

I was swimming in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
Bumped into me, I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
And there's nothing in it, and you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water
See it swimming

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
